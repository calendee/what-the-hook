# What the Hook?

This project is a basic example application to demo how react hooks work under the hook. For simplicity in rendering I am using [lit-html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/) as my render function.


### Running the app

Install the dependencies

`yarn`

Run in dev

`yarn start`
